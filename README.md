# Songs!

I'm messing around with [Sonic Pi](http://sonic-pi.net/).
I'm putting songs and experiments in this repo.

The repo makes use of the [sonic-pi-cli gem](https://github.com/Widdershin/sonic-pi-cli)
to let me easily play the songs.

## Usage:

You can either copy-and-paste the contents of a song into Sonic Pi, or you
can use the CLI.

Run Sonic Pi before doing this stuff.

### With bundler:
```bash
bundle exec ./play song1.rb
```

### Without bundler:
```bash
gem install sonic-pi-cli
./play song1.rb
```
